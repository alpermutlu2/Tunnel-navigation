# Changelog

Each version has a git tag and a metrics snapshot in `reports/<version>/metrics.json`
(`python tools/snapshot.py`). Compare two versions with
`python tools/snapshot.py --diff <old> <new>`.

Design decisions and their reasons live in `DESIGN.md` (decision log, section 11).
This file records what changed in the code and how the numbers moved.

## v0.2.0 (2026-10-19): truth generator after external review

First version under git. v0.1.0 below was not committed; it is recorded here from the
working notes so the history stays complete.

- Truth: body sideslip (`beta = -k_beta * a_lat`), phone lever arm (1.6, 0.15, 0.7) m,
  reference point = rear-axle centre. Truth no longer satisfies NHC perfectly
  (0.11 m/s lateral at the phone in S2 curves, 0.11 m/s vertical in S4 stops).
- Speed events trigger on the predicted current position (was: previous sample).
- `Road.curvature_rate()` added.
- Tests 14 -> 36: closed-form circle and Fresnel clothoid, altitude vs quadrature,
  centreline vs adaptive RK (discretisation error reported separately, max 0.07 mm),
  start/end boundaries, event trigger bound, mixed manoeuvre (brake + clothoid + grade).
- Strapdown consistency: <= 0.13 cm on S1-S5, 1.9 cm on the mixed manoeuvre. Mutation
  checks: removing lever-arm acceleration -> 1.6 m, removing beta_dot -> 8.4 m.
- DESIGN.md: grade profile no longer assumed (A3), truth/estimator separation policy,
  observability step, oracle reference, NEES/NIS metrics.

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-17): truth generator (not committed)

- Sensor profiles: Note10 (LSM6DSR) and MPU9250 Allan terms from Suvorkin et al. 2024,
  other terms marked [ASSUMED].
- Scenarios S1-S5, road geometry with clothoids and minimum-jerk grade transitions,
  minimum-jerk speed ramps.
- Truth generator without sideslip or lever arm; 14 tests, strapdown <= 0.13 cm.
- Found: piecewise-linear grade made even ideal strapdown drift 7 m on S3 (gravity leakage
  from pitch-rate steps); fixed with smooth grade transitions.
